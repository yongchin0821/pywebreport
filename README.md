# PyWebReport

Generate html reports by sources such as unittest、pytest and any more

like allure but as do-one-thing-do-it-well for **python community**.


## Current progress

## My initial idea
We may extract results in different formats from pytest、unittest. if there have a formatter to format results into the common datas,then we can use this datas to make html report.
